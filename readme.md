# Introduction
This is the repository for the course Development 1 course at Hogeschool Rotterdam.

Please head to the [modulewijzer](modulewijzer.ipynb) in order to get basic information about the course, or head to the [lessons](Lectures) for a detailed overview of all lectures.


## Setup of Jupyter
The various content files can be seen directly via GitHub.

In order to be able to open and preview (or even edit) the files locally, on your machine, you will need to [install Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

After Jupyter Notebook is installed, then just run `jupyter notebook` on your command line and navigate to the right files.

### Note on Windows
Jupyter Notebook works eccellently under [bash on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about), and is quite easy to install.
