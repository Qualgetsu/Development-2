    "## About naming things\n",
    "Suppose we were writing a simple program that begins with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "age := int(input())\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the computer, this program is effectively exactly the same as a similar program in which the variable is renamed, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x := int(input())\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "paycheck := int(input())\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, since variable names are words (`or_even_sentences`) in natural language, the moment we read that a variable is called _age_, then we automatically assume that it will have something to do with the age of some entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, suppose the initial program went on as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "age := int(input())\n",
    "region := input()\n",
    "print(\"Your wine is \" + str(age) + \" years old and comes from \" + region)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then it would be immediately clear that the program works with wines, but if the program said:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "age := int(input())\n",
    "region := input()\n",
    "print(\"Your car is \" + str(age) + \" years old and was built in \" + region)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then we immediately get another image in our mind. Of course, we could also write a (nonsensical?) program such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "region := int(input())\n",
    "age := input()\n",
    "print(\"Your wine is \" + str(region) + \" years old and comes from \" + age)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the program is nonsensical here refers to the fact that the names of the variables does not reflect their meaning in human intuition and understanding. The program will work, and produce a reasonable result to the end user, but this result is obfuscated by a very poor naming convention. In a similarly absurd fashion, we could choose to name all of our variables `v1`, `v2`, etc., resulting in poorly understandable programs such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "v1 := int(input())\n",
    "v2 := input()\n",
    "print(\"Your wine is \" + str(v1) + \" years old and comes from \" + v2)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is also obscure to understand, and it is easy to imagine that at a larger scale (inside a much longer program) this practice would make for impenetrable programs that a reader can hardly understand at a glance."

    "## Giving names to code\n",
    "For the reasons given above, the ability to give names is fundamental, and gives rise to what we call a (primitive) _taxonomy_. A taxonomy is an ordering of something into related concepts which all get a label, or name. A program does, indeed, label concepts with names (variables) which then have some relation with other concepts embodied by the code that ties concepts together by means of expressions. By giving the _right_ names, we define the concepts that will be useful when building the solution to a problem in a way that makes them also _recognizable_ at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the only concepts that earned the right to a name were _values_, meaning we could defined a hollow square as full lines and hollow lines stored in variables and then later composed together in the final picture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n := int(input())\n",
    "full_line := \"\"\n",
    "i := n\n",
    "while i > 0 do full_line := full_line + \"*\"; i := i - 1\n",
    "hollow_line := \"*\"\n",
    "i := n-2\n",
    "while i > 0 do hollow_line := hollow_line + \" \"; i := i - 1\n",
    "hollow_line := hollow_line + \"*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "s := full_line + \"\\n\"\n",
    "while n > 0:\n",
    "  s := s + hollow_line + \"\\n\"\n",
    "  n := n - 1\n",
    "s := s + full_line + \"\\n\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that by virtue of the names given to the line variables, we can encode _concepts_ that are not enough to solve the problem by themselves, but which are _a necessary part_ of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we could say that a full line is a string, but what about _drawing a full line_? A string is _a thing_ in our taxonomy, and not enough to represent the concept of _performing an action_. Performing _actions_ is the quintessential domain of code, in that code is dynamic (_actions_) whereas state is static (_things_).\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, we feel a bit limited by our inability to give names to _things_ only, because a taxonomy might very well include concepts such as \"turn left\", \"draw an asterisk\", \"draw a full line of length `n`\", and so on, which are perfectly valid and name-worthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving names is usually done by binding a name to a value in the state. In order to give names to code, we want to be able to store, inside the state, blocks of code in addition to the other values (numbers, booleans, etc.). Such \"code values\" are called _lambda expressions_. The name, which sounds cospicuously impenetrable (what is a _lambda_ after all and what does it have to do with code?), goes back to the tradition of the very first programming languages. In the 1930's, Alonzo Church defined the first programming language, the _lambda calculus_, in which the definition of reusable code blocks was already present under the name \"lambda expression\" or \"lambda term\". For this reason, the name has remained unchanged over the decades, and is still used nowadays. We will see the word \"lambda\" even in Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "A lambda expression will support the basic form `<() => S>`, where `S` is a statement called _body_. Notice that code is, as always, surrounded by angle brackets `<` and `>`. Whenever we pass code blocks around, just like we did for our $\\text{eval}$ function, we will surround them by these brackets. We say that code inside such brackets is \"quoted\", or a \"code quotation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore extend our state so that it can also contain lambda expressions. This could give rise to states containing lambda expressions, such as for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\{ x := 0; \\text{incr} := \\texttt{<() => x := x + 1>} \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to bind a value to a name in the state, then we must support expressions of this value in our programming language. Just like we could write `x := 1`, we want to be able to write `incr := <() => x := x + 1>`. For example, we could write a program such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x := 0\n",
    "incr := <() => x := x + 1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which simply produces the state seen above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions such as `x + y` will implicitly replace `x` and `y` with whatever value they are bound to in the state. Expressions as we have seen so far are \"consumers\", or \"users\", of bindings, in the sense that they make "
