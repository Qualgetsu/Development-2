    "So far we have discussed some possibilities unlocked by higher order functions and partial application. Such a discussion is, in some sense, theoretical. Limiting one to only the theory, and then stating that \"application is an excercise left to the reader\" with an implication of triviality is inadequate. While it is certainly true that the theory lights the way and shows us the direction of what is indeed possible, it is the daily practice of the engineer that truly turns this potential into reality. Believing that this translation of the ideal into the pragmatic requires little more than faithful knowledge of the theory is childishly na√Øve at best. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we will now focus on building simple but concrete programs with the aforementioned techniques, in order to complement our first intuition with lots of examples.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Theory and practice together form a unit which cannot be easily dissolved. Theory defines general patterns, whereas practice concerns itself with the many concrete instances that such patterns represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "There tends to be much more practice than theory. Take _functions_ as an example. The theory will simply state that functions exist, are defined and work in a given way. The practice of functions is much more complex: we must learn to interpret a real-world phenomenon in terms of functions, define the function itself, give it a name, etc. Moreover, while there exists a limited number (for the sake of this discussion let us say: *just one*) of useful definitions of the concept of functions, at the same time there exist infinite many concrete functions in practice that we might \"type in code\". Some of these are good and reasonable code, others are good code but very slow to run, others are bad code but very fast to run, other function implementations are intuitive, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The apparent chaos inherent to the concrete application of the practice is what leads us to building something of value and of use. Theory brings order to this chaos so that we can see underlying patterns and more effectively work our way through to our goals.\n",

    "\n",
    "This way of interpreting code does not match the way that code would exactly be read, since we are not talking about arithmetic operations such as the sum of strings. This mismatch between reading and interpretation is not just merely annoying: it can be a source of dissonance between our expectations and what the code really does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our target is to be able to write code that literally matches the description: `then(asterisk, line(n-1))`. This would be read as `asterisk then line(n-1)` if we consider `then` to be a prefix operator, that is an operator which is written to the left of the arguments. Given our current state of the art, this is the best we can do, but moving forward with classes and methods it will be possible to improve on the readability even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a minor snag along the way: `then` does not work with strings, but rather with functions as parameters. This means that both `asterisk` and `line(n-1)` must return _functions_, which `then` will combine together, instead of just strings. This leads us to reformulating the task we expect of `line` so that it matches this new requirement:\n",

    "\n",
    "This means that `line(3)` does not directly return `\"***\"`. Rather, it returns a function which we can further invoke, with an extra set of parentheses with arguments between them. Thus, `line(3)(\"\")` would yield `\"***\"`. Furthermore, `line(3)(\"...\")` would give us `\"...***\"`, meaning that `line` simply \"keeps drawing\" from a given starting point. This has a major consequence: `line` is now ready to be concatenated to other drawing functions: `then(line(3), line(2))` would give us back a function which adds `\"*****\"` to whatever input it further receives. We can thus keep composing: `then(line(3), then(line(2), line(1)))` would give us back a function which adds `\"******\"` to whatever input it further receives, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to this new, composable formulation of drawing:\n",
    "- drawing nothing will simply add nothing to the string it receives as input\n",
    "- drawing an asterisk will simply add an asterisk to the string it receives as input\n",
    "- drawing a newline will simply add a newline to the string it receives as input    \n",
