    "We now continue our journey to capture independent units of logic in the form of functions. So far, we have defined basic functions, shown how the stack allows us to define a local environment, called the scope, in which functions may save their own private data without conflicting with other functions, and finally we have shown that, with such a mechanism, functions may nest calls to each other without much danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we still have to tackle one last gray area: functions that *write* to the same global variable can produce a clash, which is an unwanted dangerous behaviour. For example, consider the functions `incr := <k => x := x + k>` and `mul := <k => x := x * k>`. Both functions write to the global variable `x` in order to be able to \"leave a trace\" of what they have computed. This makes sense given our framework so far, since a function that leaves no trace anywhere in the state is useless, so some form of result must remain behind after the function is done. The issue is that for the two functions we have just seen, the fact that they both act on `x` induces a coordination between them that might not be desirable. For example, if we execute the following program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x := 1\n",
    "incr(3)\n",
    "mul(2)\n",

    "mul(2)\n",
    "incr(3)\n",

Since `s` is also used by the line-drawing functions, everytime we draw a line then `s` gets effectively reset. We might \"solve\" this issue by backing `s` up before drawing each line or by using a temporary variable to accumulate the results before moving them to `s`, for example by restructuring the function above as follows:\n",

There is no safe way to make use of the functions `draw_full_line` and `draw_hollow_line` without explicitly keeping track of what variables they will write. This defeats the purpose of isolated units of computation, and clearly breaks isolation (also known as **encapsulation** in this kind of context). Ideally, we would like to ensure that functions are completely independent from each other, and our definition so far is weak because functions depend too much on the variables they write. A good programming language must adjust to the logical concepts we try to express, not the other way around, so we must address this issue!"

    "## Returning\n",
    "The area in which we are having trouble is the communication of the results of a function to its caller. To achieve this, our functions simply write to a previously agreed-upon location in the state, and callers will find the result there. In the previous examples about drawing, this \"agreed-upon location\" was variable `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the only variables that are available to each function, caller and callee, are the global variables, sharing them across functions will produce conflicts. Such conflicts, which are broadly known as _data races_ or _race conditions_, are some of the most subtle bugs, and are often very difficult to reproduce and debug. Such a source of danger should be managed at the language level so that we do not have to regularly rely on a feature that is so easy to use incorrectly to almost be seen as a design issue of the language itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want to achieve is a safe place for each function to store its output, so that the act of _returning a result_ from a function happens in isolation from all other functions. This increases overall isolation of the different parts of our programs, and as such is a positive and desirable property.\n",
    "\n",
    "To return a result we introduce a new statement, unsurprisingly called `return`. Its syntax is simply `return E`, where `E` is the expression that we want to return. Such an expression can be as simple (`3+x`) or as complex (`f(x) + g(y)`) as we want.\n",

    "\n",
    "A function might now result in something else other than just the `done` statement when it terminates. This means that the semantics of `call` must be adjusted in order to consider the scenario of a function which terminates by returning a value, which is handled by removing the `call` statement and simply yielding the value as a result:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\text{eval(<call(return C)>, S)} \\rightarrow \\text{<C>, S[stack := S[stack][t]]}$ when $\\text{C}$ is a (constant) value\n",

    "\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Now that we have acquired the ability for functions to communicate with the calling context by means of return, we can safely assume we will not need anymore to *write* to global variables from inside a function. This ability we are giving up is dangerous, as it can lead to very complex and unpredictable code. We needed it before defining `return`, since otherwise our functions were unable to produce any meaningful effects on the global state, but now this effect will be mediated by assigning (or further returning) the result of a function.\n",
