    "## About naming things\n",
    "Suppose we were writing a simple program that begins with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "age := int(input())\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the computer, this program is effectively exactly the same as a similar program in which the variable is renamed, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x := int(input())\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "paycheck := int(input())\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, since variable names are words (`or_even_sentences`) in natural language, the moment we read that a variable is called _age_, then we automatically assume that it will have something to do with the age of some entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, suppose the initial program went on as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "age := int(input())\n",
    "region := input()\n",
    "print(\"Your wine is \" + str(age) + \" years old and comes from \" + region)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then it would be immediately clear that the program works with wines, but if the program said:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "age := int(input())\n",
    "region := input()\n",
    "print(\"Your car is \" + str(age) + \" years old and was built in \" + region)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then we immediately get another image in our mind. Of course, we could also write a (nonsensical?) program such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "age := input()\n",
    "region := int(input())\n",
    "print(\"Your wine is \" + str(region) + \" years old and comes from \" + age)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the program is nonsensical here refers to the fact that the names of the variables do not reflect their meaning in human intuition and understanding. The program will work, and produce a reasonable result to the end user, but this result is obfuscated by a very poor naming convention. In a similarly absurd fashion, we could choose to name all of our variables `v1`, `v2`, etc., resulting in poorly understandable programs such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "v1 := int(input())\n",
    "v2 := input()\n",
    "print(\"Your wine is \" + str(v1) + \" years old and comes from \" + v2)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is also obscure to understand, and it is easy to imagine that at a larger scale (inside a much longer program) this practice would make for impenetrable programs that a reader can hardly understand at a glance."

    "## Giving names to code\n",
    "For the reasons given above, the ability to give names is fundamental, and gives rise to what we call a (primitive) _taxonomy_. A taxonomy is an ordering of something into related concepts which all get a label, or name. A program does, indeed, label concepts with names (variables) and the expressions written in the code tie these concepts together making their relatioships explicit. By giving the _right_ names, we define the concepts that will be useful when building the solution to a problem in a way that makes them also _recognizable_ at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the only concepts that earned the right to a name were _values_, meaning we could define a hollow square as full lines and hollow lines stored in variables and then later composed together in the final picture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n := int(input())\n",
    "full_line := \"\"\n",
    "i := n\n",
    "while i > 0 do full_line := full_line + \"*\"; i := i - 1\n",
    "hollow_line := \"*\"\n",
    "i := n-2\n",
    "while i > 0 do hollow_line := hollow_line + \" \"; i := i - 1\n",
    "hollow_line := hollow_line + \"*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "s := full_line + \"\\n\"\n",
    "while n > 2\n",
    "  s := s + hollow_line + \"\\n\"\n",
    "  n := n - 1\n",
    "s := s + full_line + \"\\n\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that by virtue of the names given to the line variables, we can encode _concepts_ that are not enough to solve the problem by themselves, but which are _a necessary part_ of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we could say that a full line is a string, but what about _drawing a full line_? A string is _a thing_ in our taxonomy, and not enough to represent the concept of _performing an action_. Performing _actions_ is the quintessential domain of code, in that code is dynamic (_actions_) whereas state is static (_things_).\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, we feel a bit limited by our ability to only give names to _things_, because a taxonomy might very well include concepts such as \"turn left\", \"draw an asterisk\", \"draw a full line of length `n`\", and so on, which are perfectly valid and name-worthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving names is usually done by binding a name to a value in the state. In order to give names to code, we want to be able to store, inside the state, blocks of code in addition to the other values (numbers, booleans, etc.). Such \"code values\" are called _lambda expressions_. The name, which sounds cospicuously impenetrable (what is a _lambda_ after all and what does it have to do with code?), goes back to the tradition of the very first programming languages. In the 1930's, Alonzo Church defined the first programming language, the _lambda calculus_, in which the definition of reusable code blocks was already present under the name \"lambda expression\" or \"lambda term\". For this reason, the name has remained unchanged over the decades, and is still used nowadays. We will see the word \"lambda\" even in Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "A lambda expression will support the basic form `<() => L>`, where `L` is a statement called _body_. Notice that code is, as always, surrounded by angle brackets `<` and `>`. Whenever we pass code blocks around, just like we did for our $\\text{eval}$ function, we will surround them by these brackets. We say that code inside such brackets is \"quoted\", or a \"code quotation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore extend our state so that it can also contain lambda expressions. This could give rise to states containing lambda expressions, such as for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\{ x := 0; \\text{incr} := \\text{< () } => x := x + 1> \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to bind a lambda expression to a name in the state, then we must support expressions of this kind in our programming language. Just like we could write `x := 0`, we want to be able to write `incr := <() => x := x + 1>`. For example, we could write a program such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x := 0\n",
    "incr := <() => x := x + 1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which simply produces the state seen above. The combination of the name (`incr`) and its associated lambda expression (`<() => x := x + 1>`) are, together, called _a function_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions such as `x + y` inside a lambda expression will implicitly replace `x` and `y` with whatever value they are bound to in the state. Expressions as we have seen so far are \"consumers\", or \"users\", of bindings, in the sense that they make use of the values stored in the state by substituting names for values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make use of lambda expressions in the state just like we can use a number in the state, we need to introduce a new sort of expression or statement which will be able to perform the lookup of the lambda expression from the state and then do something meaningful with it. This instruction is called _invocation_ and has a very simple syntax: `V()`, where `V` is the name of the variable bound to a lambda. The semantics of invocation are quite simple: they just replace the invocation statement with the code found in the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{eval}(<V()>, S) \\rightarrow <L>, S$ where $S[V] \\rightarrow <() \\Rightarrow L>$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see an example, step-by-step, of this new semantic rule in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x := 0\n",
    "y := 0\n",
    "incr_x := <() => x := x + 1>\n",
    "incr_y_by_x := <() => y := y + x>\n",
    "\n",
    "incr_x()\n",
    "incr_x()\n",
    "incr_y_by_x()\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[[SEMANTIC STEPS]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the last three lines of the program are very readable and human-friendly. We can quickly see that we will increment `x` twice, and then we will increment `y` by `x`. This is made possible by the combination of functions and reasonable names. Thanks to the given names, the reader is gently guided along the same train of thoughts that led the original programmer to the current solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, by invoking `incr_x` twice we avoid repeating code. Suppose we wanted to increment `x` twice, but now instead of by one by three. We only need to change the lambda expression assigned to `incr_x` to `<() => x := x + 3>`, and all of the invocations will be automatically adjusted accordingly. If we had duplicated the code `x := x + 1`, we would need to adjust this code in multiple places: this manual search-and-replace is tedious and error prone. Many bugs have been introduced by using this weak refactoring technique."

Abstraction means, indeed, removal: when we climb the abstraction ladder, then we make our program (again, in our case this would be the last five lines) shorter and less detailed. Indeed, invoking `draw_line` is far more succint and direct than the code for drawing the line itself!\n",

    "## External context and function parameters\n",
    "Lambda expressions as we have seen so far have a limitation: they encapsulate a code block (and therefore the behaviour that this code block represents), but have no way to receive some contextual information that further specifies what they must do. For example, let us consider `<() => x := x + 1>`: it clearly increments `x` by $1$. We might also want to define a lambda expression for incrementing the same variable by another number, say $2$: `<() => x := x + 2>`, or $3$: `<() => x := x + 3>`. Clearly all these functions do roughly the same (they all increment `x` by something), and so we would like to group them in a _family of functions_ that all increment `x`, but which are distinguished from each other by _how much_ they increment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinguishing of functions inside the family is done by means of an extra bit of information that we provide to the function when calling it. Such information is called a **parameter**. In the case of our example, we would write `<(k) => x := x + k>`, where `k` is a parameter that we **pass** to the function when invoking it. Invocation will therefore require us to specify the value of the parameter, for example by saying `incr_x(5)`. This value (in our case $5$) is called the **argument**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we extend our function definition syntax so that it includes parameters: `<(Pars) => L>`, where `L` is a statement and `Pars` is a series of variable names separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invocation must now supply arguments to the function, the arguments being a series of expressions such as `3`, `x + 1`, etc. The arguments are assigned to the parameters right before the function body is injected in the main program. This leads us to the following semantics:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{eval}(<V(a_1, a_2, \\dots)>, S) \\rightarrow <p_1 := a_1; p_2 := a_2; \\dots; L>, S$ where $S[V] \\rightarrow <(p_1, p_2, \\dots) \\Rightarrow L>$\n",

We will explore this concept further in the following materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define multiple parameters of a lambda expression, in order to provide a richer context.
