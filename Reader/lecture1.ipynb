    "## Opening\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is an introductory text about basic programming concepts. Before we can discuss what programming is, we need to take a step back and discuss what programming is interested about. Programming is the crucial discipline within informatica, and in its turn informatica is the broader science of encoding, storing, transforming, and manipulating information. _Information_ in this context is not a word used lightly or informally: information is meant to be precise, unambiguous, and objective. Informatica does not concern itself with purely human notions, and rather focuses on the objectively expressible and measurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also often say that information is the structure that binds everything together: it is the non-physical quality of reality that leads to more or less complex structures. As an example of information-as-structure, consider a strand of DNA code: should we take the same molecules of such a strand apart from each other, would we still get DNA? Of course not, and yet it would be the same matter. The difference between the molecules is their arrangement, which is not a physical quality, but rather information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the rest of the book, we will therefore explore the non-physical, virtual world of information and discuss how we can encode this information in a way that allows us to retrieve it, and transform it into new information via the process known as \"computing\"."

    "## Programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point, it becomes opportune to choose a programming language and start doing some actual coding in it, in order to get a feel for the subject of study. After all, we have the luxury of studying a discipline where with a cheap laptop we can run all the \"scientific\" experiments we want involving code, therefore learning more effectively and more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, which programming language shall we choose? Well, this is not so easy. There are a lot of programming languages, and they are not all equal. Given two programming languages, let's say $P_1$ and $P_2$, in some cases it might very well be that they are comparable. Not everybody agrees on the right way to compare programming languages, so form your own opinion on this. In this text, we will focus on a comparison about \"how many good programs can be built with this language?\". We will ignore available libraries, and assume that a language which helps the developer with a rich set of powerful instructions allows us to build more good programs with few (and we can dream about none at all) bugs, whereas a programming language with redundant, tiny instructions will force us to be verbose, to difficultly express many constructs, and in general will make it easier to make mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this would be a comparison between older JavaScript (ES5) and newer JavaScript (ES6). ES6 contains a series of instructions directly embedded into the language in order to more easily express difficult concepts surrounding, for example, asynchronous computations without having to explicitly build callbacks. ES6 is therefore slightly more intelligent than ES5, and this allows the programmer to focus less on small-scale technicalities, and more on the program he or she is trying to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, as we move across this landscape of languages, at some point we might for example notice that TypeScript introduces a statically checked type system which ensures that our JavaScript programs are not run when they contain major logic mistakes in the manipulation of data structures. But then, we might notice that there exist even more languages such as F#, Scala, or even Haskell where we have extremely powerful instructions, and very strong type systems: very advanced languages make it easy to express complex concepts, and also very hard to make stupid mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, there are commercial considerations also at play here. Programming languages also have libraries, and are applied in different contexts. There is a place and a reason to be for many, many programming languages: in some cases C and C++ will be very useful, in some other cases Python and Ruby, JavaScript and Php, or C# and Java, and so on. It gets slightly worse: as scientists and practitioners work tirelessly around the clock, new languages are born all the time. It might be that by the time you are done learning a language, it is already _pass√©_ and you should move on to _The Next Big Thing_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing is therefore very hard, and the moment we learn too much of a language, especially as a beginner, the more our reasoning gets conditioned by that language and the harder it is to switch to another one or even see the bigger picture!\n",
    "\n",
    "But are all these languages really so different from each other? Can they even be so different from each other? Fortunately, we know that all languages with some given capabilities (known as _Turing completeness_) will be sufficient to implement all possible programs. It might be more difficult in one language rather than the other, but it will still be possible. All the languages exemplified above are Turing complete, so choosing just one of those would be safe: you will not learn something that cannot write a given program. Moreover, all these languages will run on a suitable computer, and therefore will be bound to the capabilities of such a computing machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this book is therefore to teach first and foremost the basis concepts of computation that are shared by all programming languages. We will then move on to applying these concepts in a concrete programming language, Python, which is a simple, clean, well designed programming language with many limitations on a large scale, but also very pleasant and effective in the hands of a learner building his or her first programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects the philosophical nature of this book. We do not aim at teaching a few parlour tricks to quickly land a job. If you were looking to \"learn how to make a game in 48 hours\", then this will not be achieved in this book (unless you can read very fast, then perhaps it will still happen). This book is meant as an introductory text at the beginning of a long-term engagement to learning, so we expect the reader to give him or herself the time to appreciate the basics, and then move on to the advanced concepts in time. Mastery in any complex subject takes years, so buckle up and enjoy the ride."

    "## An abstract view of a computer\n",
    "Physically, and from an engineering point of view, computers are built out of a series of components. The most important of these components are the CPU and the memory, but there also are other IO devices connected such as keyboards, monitors, mice, etc. Let us assume that the IO devices do not matter: after all, they are simply memory which, by means of digital connections, is bound to external devices. For example, a monitor is indeed no more than one memory location (containing an RGB color) for each screen pixel. We set the color of the pixel in memory, and \"almost by magic\" the corresponding pixel lights up. For this reason, we will from now on only focus on memory and CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory stores what we call the _state_ of our program(s), whereas the CPU offers a series of possible _instructions_, each of which operates on the subsequent instructions or on the state itself.  \n",

    "Suppose that $P_1$, $P_2$, etc. are all possible programs being run, whereas $S_1$, $S_2$, etc. are all possible states of our computer. The computer in and of itself could be seen as a machine with the potential to reach all these states, but each state will be reached via a certain program. Evaluating that program _from_ a given state will produce a new program (the _rest_, or _continuation_, of the original program) and a new state. We can write this in mathematical terms by using an arrow $\\rightarrow$ to represent this evaluation process (or function):\n",

In a sense, programming forces a computer to \"restrict its attention\" to a much smaller potential subset of all the things the computer does. For now, let us metaphorically see instructions as _tools_. Suppose a computer were able to manipulate all sorts of tools: a saw, a hammer, other construction tools, but also kitchen tools such as cooking knives, forks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer can therefore potentially perform sequences of operations such as build a house, take a break, go home, cook a meal, etc. Of course, there are infinite such sequences of operations possible, resulting in a network (or graph) looking like:\n",

    "Up until now, values to the right of a binding have always been \"primitive\" values such as numbers or text. This view is slightly limiting, as sometimes a we might want a unit of information that is more complex than, for example, just a number. Suppose we wish to express a state modeling a person with a name, a surname, and a date of birth. The date of birth is not \"just a single value\": it has a day, a month, and a year. Representing a date requires a whole state itself. This suggests that sometimes we might need to express the nesting of information by binding a whole sub-state as a value.\n",

    "### About the notation\n",
    "Even though notation is only a means to an end, and getting stuck on the choice of symbols does not help anyone, since a choice of symbols is often arbitrary, it is sometimes useful to take a break and analyze the reason behind the choice of some symbols. \n",

Our sets are special sets though: in a set, the same element cannot appear twice, but in our case we have a stronger constraint: the _names_ to the left of bindings cannot be repeated. This stronger definition of set is called a _map_.\n",

    "It should be clear by now that our evaluation strategy only takes a very small step in the evaluation, that is, it is not capable of solving large problems all at once. Instead, slowly but steadily, it will transform a single piece of the program into a slightly simpler, equivalent version of itself that is one step closer to the desired target. This way, applying evaluation multiple times (potentially a very large number of times) will evaluate the whole program.\n",

    "Notice that the definition we have given about what `eval` concretely does features multiple different lines, and in each line we have defined what eval does for a particular input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when we say `eval(<up N>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<done>, S[y := S[y] + N]`, what we are stating is that when eval receives as first input a program with structure `up N`, then we have a _match_ and will yield as result the expression right of the arrow. Given that `N` could be matched to any number, we call `up N` a _pattern_ instead of a statement. When a statement such as `up 3` is matched to pattern `up N`, then we will be able to _bind_ `N` to value `3`. Since `up` is a constant (an _expression_ constant, but a constant nonetheless), it will only match with precisely itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say `eval(<I; J>, S)`, on the other hand, we have two variables: `I` and `J`. The semicolon `;` is an expression, and so it will only match with itself, whereas `I` will match with any statement left of the semicolon, and `J` will match with any statement right of the semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are matching pattern `I;J` with statement `up 3; right 2; done`. First of all, since `;` is right-associative, then our statement should be seen as `up 3; (right 2; done)`. The brackets are not meant as statements themselves, but to define the grouping and prioritization of pattern matching. Given this prioritization we get a match of `{ I := up 3, J := right 2; done }`. \n",

    "It is worthy of attention to notice that binding is also an intermediate step of pattern matching: binding is truly a remarkably recurrent concept in logical thinking.\n",
