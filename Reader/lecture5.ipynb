    "When confronted with a difficult problem, it is always helpful to draw it. The ability to draw something out is not just useful for aesthetic reasons: drawing the problem (with precision!) forces us to reckon with all the details of the problem, and to visualise them so we can properly deal with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "After drawing or plotting the problem, we look for _regularities_. Regularities are powerful elements in a solution, because they suggest the building blocks of both the problem and therefore the code that will become the solution. Such regularities present themselves as smaller instances of the problem itself, which we also call _recurring structure_ or _inductive case_. Without regularities (or without seeing them) it is very hard to produce a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have found the recurring structure, we must find what ties them together. For example, even though it is true that a line is made up of smaller lines, we must also define what \"made up of\" really means: in this case, concatenation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recurring structure should recur in a specific way: every time, at a smaller scale. The line must be made up of _smaller_ lines, and at some point we expect a line so small that we do not really need to split it further. This definition of when do we stop splitting our problem into smaller versions of itself is called the _base case_."
