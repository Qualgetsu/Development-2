    "Recursion is more difficult to get a grip on than loops. This is understandable, because whereas loops simply take steps in a sort of \"forward\" direction, recursion does something a bit more complex. When a recursive function invokes itself, then it generates a new instance of itself higher up in the stack. The calling function is not eliminated from the stack, but rather remains \"dormant\", waiting for its smaller instance to complete. When the smaller instance completes, then the caller gets resumed (\"woken up\") in order to complete its own process. This means that thinking about recursive functions must be done carefully, as they do not really match our intuition based on physical or geometric processes.\n",

If recursion is just a more convoluted way of expressing loops, then there is no point to it. If it offers more expressive power on the other hand, then it might be worth the additional complexity.\n",
