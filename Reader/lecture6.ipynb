    "Our broader goal so far has been to achieve higher and higher levels of abstraction in our code. When programming, we study a domain of application, and translate its ideas into computational concepts (data and functions). In order for the translation to reach maximum usefulness, we need this translation in code to be as close as possible to the original ideas: code must be a _precise_ and _succint_ representation. Precision is important to avoid mistakes, and brevity is needed to avoid losing our train of thought in needless details which are not really present in the original domain, but are spuriously introduced by computational mechanisms. This way, we get to express *as much concepts with as little code as possible*, reducing both the effort it takes us to write our programs and the risk of making mistakes.\n",

Specifically, both functions initialise variable `s` to some initial value (we consider this to be related to the base case of recursive functions), and then they both add a series of values which might depend on the current value of `n`. We can rewrite both functions by abstracting away the differing bits, so that the functions become identical, minus of course different definitions of the base step and the value to add at each iteration:\n",

The other argument though is not so simple to handle: `STEP` depends on `n`, and as such we might recognize that it is a function. Fortunately for us, lambda expressions are no more than values, and as such they can be passed around just like normal parameters. This means that we can simply define `repeat_add` as a function as follows:\n",

Functions that accept other functions as arguments are called _higher order functions_, shortened as HOF. We can now instantiate `repeat_add` in order to obtain one-liner definitions of both `sum` and `line`:\n",

Reading the definition of both functions now quite clearly states what the functions do, without having to read the much longer code that characterised their first implementation we gave in the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, since both `sum` and `line` (in accordance to the original definition, which we want to respect to the letter!) must take only `n` as a parameter, they both accept `n` as input and pass it through to `repeat_add`. Even though it makes sense, this bit of code that does nothing but pass a parameter through looks somewhat inelegant, and indeed it hampers the understandability of the functions. We will work on fixing this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, it is worthy of notice how, thanks to HOF's, we have achieved something significant: we have built our first function, `repeat_add`, that embodies an abstract concept such as repetition, without necessarily being bound to a concrete use-case. Our toolbox for expressing thought is growing, and when we do need to apply this toolbox to concrete problems (in our case `sum` and `add`), then it is immediately clear how powerful such a toolbox really is."

In order to express this layering of parameters, we can turn `repeat` into a function that further returns another function with `n` as parameter. This is made possible by the fact that functions are simply values, and as such they not only can be passed as parameters, but also returned:\n",

Some real-world concepts are very concrete, such as _Jim's age_ or _drawing a line_. Some real-world concepts, such as _repeating an action n times_, are less concrete, because they do not correspond to a _thing_ or _action_ themselves, but exist on a higher level of abstraction. We could call _repeat_ a _meta-action_ (or HOF).\n",
