    "In this chapter we will close the circle of functions, by showing that functions can also be used to represent complex data structures and their aggregation. The naÃ¯ve interpretation of functions imposes a somewhat false dichotomy between state and actions, where functions are merely relegated to containers of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A broader interpretation of functions would begin by realising that state itself can be easily modeled as function. For example, there is no actual difference between a number, such as `3`, and a function that always returns that number, such as `three := () => 3`. The fact that the function definition will first require a call does not change the fact that it merely acts as a container for `3`, and as such the two definitions are equivalent. Moreover, given any piece of state `C`, we could encapsulate it in a function `() => C` which does nothing but returning its value. This means that for every value we could possibly conceive, there exists a function which sole purpose is to return it. This means that `State <= Functions`. The opposite is not true. Simplifying broadly, we can easily imagine that even if we managed to encode functions cleverly in the form of variables, we would still at some point need functions in order to evaluate such an encoding, or _call the function_ as it were. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can conclude that functions are the fundamental unit of computation, and even more so the only construct we should really be focusing on. Indeed, even concepts such as object-orientation, inheritance, and much more are trivial to encode and represent only in terms of functions and their composition. We will see more of this in the coming units, but in the rest of this chapter we will show how to build a simple (but not trivial) data structure representing pictures only by means of functions."
