    "The activities performed are:\n",
    "- introduction:\n",
    "    - we are here to study informatica\n",
    "    - informatica is the discipline of structured, automated storage and manipulation of information\n",
    "    - information is the structure that binds everything together\n",
    "    - describe the huge partial order of programming languages and their relationships\n",
    "    - ... < PHP < Python < JavaScript (ES5) < JavaScript (ES6) < TypeScript\n",
    "    - ... < Pascal < C++ < D < ...\n",
    "    - ... F# < Scala < AGDA < Coq < ...    \n",
    "    - we want to learn as many as possible: the toolbox is not large enough\n",
    "    - moreover, this picture shifts dramatically every few years (**scientific** research is happening all the time!)\n",
    "    - we cannot teach students just a few tricks to find a job\n",
    "        - we want to teach the tools and the underlying language-independent tricks in order for students to be able to *learn each language*, past, present, or future, independently and effectively\n",
    "        - for this reason we will not just do a series of workshop in the style of \"how to build a React website in 72 hours\"\n",
    "        - we will dive into the (beautiful) foundations of programming languages elements, and then later on connect it to some concrete examples; this year we will see mostly Python, C#, and some Java, but we will see very little of the tools and very much of the concepts\n",
    "        - you have **four years** to become next level professionals, enjoy the ride and buckle up!\n",
    "- physical definition of a computer as memory plus CPU plus IO;\n",
    "- operations definition of a computer as state (memory) plus _possible_ instructions;\n",
    "- abstract definition of a computer as an infinite graph of all possible sequences of states and instructions dictated by programs;\n",
    "- examples/drawing of (a tiny piece) of such graph;\n",
    "- programs restrict our attention to a very small, but still potentially infinite, subset of such graph;\n",
    "- define a binding as the fundamental unit of information: $n := v$, where $n$ is the name and $v$ is a value (let us start with only alphanumeric symbols such as 1, \"Hello\", etc.);\n",
    "- explain what a definition is, and that in a definition such as the one above, $n$ and $v$ are just _placeholders_ to be filled in;\n",
    "- give numerous examples (at least five, aim for ten), of bindings: use abstract names such as $x := 5$, then move on to more logic bindings such as $year := 2017$;\n",
    "- define a state as a map (set plus constraints) of bindings: $\\{ n_1 := v_1, n_2 := v_2, \\dots \\}$;\n",
    "- give numerous examples (at least five) of states: begin with abstract variable names $\\{ x := 1, y := 2 \\}$, then move on to concrete examples such as $\\{ day := 2, month := 3, year := 1985 \\}$;\n",
    "- discuss lookup on a state $\\{ x := 1, y := 2 \\}[x] \\rightarrow 1$ and how it reads in english;\n",
    "- discuss the arrow in the notation for lookup as _computation_ (\"computation is following arrows until there are no more arrows to follow\");\n",
    "- show five examples of lookup, ranging from the abstract to the concrete;\n",
    "- discuss binding on a state $\\{ x := 1, y := 2 \\}[x := 5] \\rightarrow \\{ x := 5, y := 2 \\}$;\n",
    "- show five examples of binding, ranging from the abstract to the concrete; \n",
    "- discuss removal from a state $\\{ x := 1, y := 2, z := 3 \\} - [ z ] \\rightarrow \\{ x := 1, y := 2 \\}$;\n",
    "- show five examples of removal, ranging from the abstract to the concrete; \n",
    "- explain that state can nest, that is the right side of a binding can be another state;\n",
    "- show five examples of nesting ranging from the abstract to the concrete, for example $\\{ jim := \\{ name := Jim, surname := Mij \\} \\}$\n",
    "- show lookup on a nested state, such as $\\{ jim := \\{ name := Jim, surname := Mij \\} \\}[jim][name] \\rightarrow \\{ name := Jim, surname := Mij \\}[name] \\rightarrow Jim$\n",
    "- show binding on a nested state;\n",
    "- discuss our first complex computation, and how it chained two smaller computations to produce a bigger one;\n",
    "- define a language as a series of possible statements, which are combined into a program;\n",
    "- define a statement as:\n",
    "    - syntax: structured text with nested variable parts, such as `if c then p else q`;\n",
    "    - semantics: how the statement transforms itself and a state into a new statement and a new state (also nested: see above, semantics of `p`);\n",
    "- define a program step as taking a program and a state, checking the current instruction, and deriving a new program (the rest) and a new state by following the semantics of the current instruction: `P,S` $\\rightarrow$ `P',S'`;\n",
    "- define running a program as starting from the program and the initial state, and taking steps until there are no more steps to take;\n",
    "- define a tiny language, `Turtle`, with the following statements:\n",
    "    - `up N`, where `N` is an arbitrary integer number;\n",
    "    - `down N`, where `N` is an arbitrary integer number;\n",
    "    - `left N`, where `N` is an arbitrary integer number;\n",
    "    - `right N`, where `N` is an arbitrary integer number;\n",
    "    - `pen B`, where `B` is `on` or `off`;\n",
    "    - `done`;\n",
    "    - `I;J`, where `I` and `J` are arbitrary statements;\n",
    "    - this is the *syntax* of the program: what for *keywords* we reserve for special meaning (`up`, `done`, `pen`).\n",
    "- introduce the concept of `eval : ` $Stmt \\times State \\rightarrow Stmt \\times State$\n",
    "    - `eval` implicitly performs _pattern matching_ to decide the right-hand side\n",
    "- define the semantics of `Turtle`, taking the time to illustrate each statement with an example, as:\n",
    "    - `eval(<up N>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<done>, S[y := S[y] + N]`;\n",
    "    - `eval(<down N>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<done>, S[y := S[y] - N]`;\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "    - `eval(<pen B>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<done>, S[p := B]`;\n",
    "    - `eval(<done>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<done>, S`;\n",
    "    - `eval(<I; J>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<I';J>, S'` given that `eval(<I>,S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<I'>, S'` and `I` $\\neq$ `done`;\n",
    "    - `eval(<done; I>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<I>, S`;\n",
    "    - this is the *semantics* of the program: what do combinations of keywords **do** when activated.\n",
    "- notice that `<X>` means `instruction X` and that the initial state is always $\\{ x := 0, y := 0, p := on \\}$;\n",
    "    - Programming languages convert numbers and arithmetic expressions from text, to the physical instructions of the CPU that can perform such operations. Therefore, we need a reason to distinguish between the instructions, still written in text and being interpreted, and the actual operations performed by the computer;\n",
    "    - We use quotations: `<X>` denote the literal code `X`;\n",
    "    - For example, `<3 + 2>` means \"the code, written by a programmer and processed by the machine, of number three, symbol plus, and then number two\";\n",
    "    - This avoids ambiguity, because if we then say $3 + 2$, then we mean the arithmetic expression that will lead to $5$;\n",
    "- given that the state for a `Turtle` program is $\\{ x := 2, y := 0, p:= off \\}$, and that a `Turtle` program terminates when it reaches the configuration `<done>, S`.\n",
    "    - Show how to run the following program: `up 2; up 2; right 2; right 2; down 2; down 2; left 2; left 2; done`;\n",
    "    - Complete the following program on `...` : `pen on; up 2; right 2; down 2; left 2; ...; down` to show a figure."
