    "    - this increases isolation, so it is a positive property\n",
    "- we introduce the new statement, `return`\n",
    "- the syntax is `return E`, where `E` is any expression (also another function call!)\n",
    "- the semantics simply evaluates the expression until it is a constant value:\n",
    "    - $\\text{eval(<return C>, S)} \\rightarrow \\text{<C>, S}$ when $\\text{C}$ is a (constant) value\n",
    "    - $\\text{eval(<return E>, S)} \\rightarrow \\text{<return E'>, S'}$ where $\\text{eval(<E>, S)} \\rightarrow \\text{<E'>, S'}$\n",
    "- the fact that a function might result in something else other than just the `done` statement means that we also have to adjust the semantics of `call`:\n",
    "    - $\\text{eval(<call(return C)>, S)} \\rightarrow \\text{<C>, S[stack := S[stack][t]]}$ when $\\text{C}$ is a (constant) value\n",
    "    - $\\text{eval(<call(return C; ...)>, S)} \\rightarrow \\text{<C>, S[stack := S[stack][t]]}$ when $\\text{C}$ is a (constant) value\n",
